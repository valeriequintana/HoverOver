# HoverOver
Version 1.0

Hover Over is science fiction, semi-exploration, obstacle course game that emphasizes the player to find their destination. This game is made for PC using Unity 5.3 and is being developed by a Valerie Quintana, a student at Rutgers University â€“ New Brunswick in New Jersey. This game started its production in May and is a postmortem of our first release build of the game. The game is still in development at this time and I am working on the next planned release in a few short weeks.
